Labium in collaboration with the Cognitive and Communication Technologies (TCC) division of
Fondazione Bruno Kessler built the semantic network for the Latin WordNet, as part of the
MultiWordnet project (http://multiwordnet.itc.it/english/home.php).

The database, which contains around 9,000 lemmas, was first developed by Stefano Minozzi
starting from the words listed in Lessico Fondamentale Latino by E. Riganti (Bologna, 1989).

This distribution contains a revised version of the Latin WordNet that has been
corrected and expanded by W. M. Short of the University of Exeter. Eventually it will be
updated to include nearly 70,000 lemmas.

Data for Portuguese is based on the openWordNet-PT (http://github.com/own-pt/openWordnet-PT) by Escola de Matemática Aplicada, Fundação Getulio Vargas is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
